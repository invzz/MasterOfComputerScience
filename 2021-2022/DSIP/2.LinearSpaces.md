## Linear Independence

a bunch of elements of linear spaces if there is only one way to get the 0 element, and that way is the trivial one.

let's dive in

Let's find the linear independent pairs among any $u=(2,3,4), v= (3,4,5), w(-6,-8,-10)$

so let's try "u,v" $\alpha(2,3,4) + \beta(3,4,5) = 0 $

dividing by $\beta$
$$
\alpha(2,3,4) + (3,4,5) = 0.
$$

has no solutions!

so first pair is ilinearly independent.
same goes for $v,w$ 

and $u, w$ ? 

$$3\alpha-6\beta=0\\4\alpha-8\beta=0\\3\alpha-10\beta=0$$

Has a solution! which means that these two vector are basically the same or better these two vectors resides on the same plane.

**Linear span** if we take a set o vectors $V=v_1,...,v_n$
a linear span is $W = span(V)$ where $W \subseteq V$

**basis** is a linear span that fill all the space.

**Scalar product** (euclidean vector space)

$(u,v) = \sum_i{v_iv_i}$

Is the energy and is definide by the scalar product of a vector with itself

$|| v ||^2 = (v,v)$

$||u-u||=0$ iff $u=v$

- Famous consequences

- $||\alpha w|| = |\alpha|\cdot||w ||$
- no proof given but invited kindly to prove it
  
$||u+v|| <= ||u ||+||v||$

This might be viewed in some sense as the angle between vectors!

$|(u,v)| <= ||u ||\cdot ||v|| $

## Angle and orthogonality

$\theta = \arccos\left(\dfrac{(u,v)}{||u||\cdot||v||}\right)$

$(u,v) = 0 $ iff $u,v$ are orthogonals

if $u,v$ are orthogonal then $||u + v||^2 = ||u||^2 + || v ||^2 $
