## What is a Distribuited System

A distribuited system is a network of autonomous computers that are connected using a distribuited middleware.

they help in sharing different resources and capabilities to provide users with a single and coherent network.

Main features

- several autonomous nodes
- each node has its own local memory
- nodes communicate with each other with by message passing

---

## Properties

- Location transparency: resource centric
- Concurrent computation on different nodes
- No shared memory
- Absense of a global state
- Fault tolerance mechanism
- Hetereogencity in both hw and sw

Designing Distribuited Systems are complex systems that are difficult to design.

## Distribuited Systems architectures

- **Client / server** 
  - server store the state of the application
- **Three Tier**
  - Eg. web applications
- **N-Tier**
  - they forwars requests to other services Eg. application servers 
  - Microservices
- **Peer-to-peer**
  - responsabilities are spread among the nodes which can serve both as clients and servers. This is the purest truly distributed architecture.

---

## Communication and Coordination

- **Master/Slave**
  - processes communicate with each other
- **Data Centric**
  - communication among processes is done using a shared database.

---

## Synchronous Distribuited Systems

- **Upper bound** on message delivery
- **Ordered message** delivery
- **Global clock**
- **Lock-step** based distribution

---

## Asynchronous Distribuited Systems

- **Clock** may be not accurate, out of sync
- **Messages** can be delayed for arbitrary period of time

---

## What do we want

- **Interoperability**
- **Integration**
- **Flexibility** (modifications at runtime)
- **Modularity**
- **Scalability**
- **Quality** of service and availability
- **Transparency** w.r.t. data, location,migration, replication, concurrency, failures

---

## Examples

- Network file system (hadoop FS)
- Distributed Objects (java RSE for instance)
- Distributed Databases
- Distribuited Pub / Sub systems
  - Redis
  - RabbitMQ
- Distribuited data acquisition services
  - kafka
  - spark

## Distributed Algorithms

Distributed algorithms is often modeled as algorithms working on graphs

- Network is the **graph**
- Process are the **nodes** in the graph
- **Edges** are the communication links between nodes

---

## Classical problems

- Leader election
- Mutual exclusion
- Clock sync
- Global snapshot
- Consensus in presence of failures
- Routing / route maintenance

## Assumptions

- Sync / Async
- Message loss / Delays
- Node / Byzantine Faults

---

## Relaxing Algorithms

- Randomized algorithms
- Programming strategies
